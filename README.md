# ðŸ“š Book Tracker

A simple and responsive web application that allows users to track books they've read or plan to read. Users can **add**, **view**, **edit**, and **delete** books â€” implementing full CRUD functionality using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Book data is stored in the browser with `localStorage`, so no backend is needed.
